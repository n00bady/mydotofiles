# My dotfiles
These are my dot files, there are many like them but these are mine :)

## Hyprland config
My Hyprland config is based on the dotfiles of 
[ML4W](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles).

- Colors based on the gruvbox palette (mostly).
- `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME` set to `kde` and the qt theme selection happens from 
kde settings. Also for the `SDDM` too. The current theme set is 
[**Psion**](https://store.kde.org/p/2138046).
- `GTK` apps theme is set with `nwg-look` and the current theme is set to use 
[**orthogonal-markers**](https://git.disroot.org/eudaimon/orthogonal-markers). 
Orthogonal-markers is set to use `skeuo` as theme and `dark-partii.css` for colors.
- For a bar I use `waybar`.
- I have some scripts for reloading wallpaper, waybar and others in the `hyprScripts/`
folder to use with keybinds.
- And most of the **Hypr** ecosystem for the rest (hyprpaper, hypridle, hyprlock, etc...)

Applications I use with **hyprland**:
- User shell: `fish`.  
For the prompt I use [starship](https://starship.rs/).
- Terminal: `kitty`.  
Also I use the kitty-themes specifically `gruvbox_dark.conf`.  
- Text editor: `neovim`.  
It's config is based on [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) and it's theme is set to gruvbox.
- Media Player: `mpv`.
- File Manager: `PCManFM-qt`.
- App Launcher: `rofi`.
- Browser: `zen-browser` or `brave`.
- PDF: `okular` or `zathura`.
- Notifications: `dunst`.
